# OptPrice
Simple Streamlit application implementing the Black-Scholes model for European option pricing. The app allows users to calculate option prices, explore sensitivities (Greeks), and visualize results through interactive graphs, heatmaps, and 3D surfaces, enhancing the analysis of financial options.

This project is an interactive Streamlit-based application that employs the Black-Scholes model to analyze European call and put options. The app computes option prices and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho) based on user-defined parameters such as stock price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. It provides advanced visualization tools, including line plots, heatmaps, and 3D surfaces, to offer a comprehensive understanding of the option pricing landscape. Additionally, users can save and load configurations and export results for further analysis. This project is ideal for financial analysts, traders, and educators aiming to explore option pricing and sensitivities interactively.
